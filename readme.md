# Fetchr-go

## Quick Info

This is my attempt to learn Go by reimplementing my senior project [Fetchr](github.com/dsafanyuk/fetchr) backend. (originally written in Node.js).

Fetchr is a service that has 2 main functions: 

- users  browse products, add items to carts, checkout
- couriers  browse open orders, accept open orders, deliver their assigned orders
